There are three data files that have been cleaned up for public use:
discipline_data.csv is the faculty data aggregated by subdiscipline
grad_postdoc_data.csv is postdoc and graduate student data (from https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvygradpostdoc/)
grad_time_data.csv is graduate data over time (from https://www.nsf.gov/statistics/srvydoctorates/)

The python notebook, data_analysis.ipynb, provides code to reproduce all plots in the paper. Some figures are slightly different as they were edited in illustrator, but similar versions can be made here.
